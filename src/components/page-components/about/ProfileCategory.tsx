        Right now, I'm in my last year in vocational high school with a major in
        software engineering. I love almost all about web development and
        backend services.

      <p className="font-axiforma text-2xl">
        I have been learning to program for 5 years and experienced in both
        frontend and backend development of Interactive Web Applications,
        incorporation of concepts into a framework, and preparation for a stage
        of development. I am a quick-learner and collaborative. I have interests
        such as Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, and video games ðŸ™‚
